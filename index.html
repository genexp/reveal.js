            <h2>
              “How many of you have been on a team in a state of shared vision?” This is the question Jim McCarthy used to kick off last night’s Agile Boston presentation. “Now, stay standing if you thought that team was at least 2x as effective as a team without one… 5x more effective… 10x more effective.”  The majority of us stayed standing throughout. 10 TIMES more effective!
            </h2>

          <section>
            <h2>
              In every kickass company, there’s an inherent focus. Trusted and trustworthy teams each know the role they play in a company’s overall success and understand that what they do each day contributes. Teams ask, “How will this get us and the company closer to each of our goals?” That one question makes kickass companies nimble. When you create aligned teams, everyone’s asking better questions. It’s those questions that spawn solutions that change careers, industries, and challenge the status quo.
